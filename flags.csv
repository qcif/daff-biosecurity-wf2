2,Taxa of interest,B,Taxon of interest detected,At least one of the taxa of interest matched the candidates species,3
4,Reference sequence source diversity,A,Matching sequence records for this species are from >5 independent sources,Reference sequences are from diverse sources and therefore likely to be reliable,1
4,Reference sequence source diversity,B,Matching sequence records for this species have only 1-5 independent sources,Reference sequence sources lack diversity and may therefore be unreliable,2
5.1,Database representation for target taxon,A,The given locus for this taxon is well represented in reference database (>5 entries),The reference data supports this taxon well,1

5.1,Database representation for target taxon,C,The given locus for this taxon is not present in reference database (0 entries),The reference database is likely to be unreliable for this species,3
5.1,Database representation for target taxon,NA,Assessment of related species is only possible for taxa at rank genus/species,This taxon could not be fully assessed,0
5.2,Database representation for related taxon,A,>90% of related taxa have reference sequence(s) at the given locus,The database supports species in this genus well,1

5.3,Database representation for target taxon,NA,Assessment of related species is only possible for taxa at rank genus/species,This taxon could not be fully assessed,0
6,Intraspecies diversity,A,Candidate species grouped within single clade,The query sequence is genetically consistent with sequences of the best-matching species,1
6,Intraspecies diversity,B,The query sequence clusters as sister to a species-specific clade or as a single branch in a tree,"The sample is genetically distinct from the sequences of the best-matching species, and may lack representation in the reference database. This indicates that the sample organism is either poorly studied or a potential novel species.",2
6,Intraspecies diversity,C,Genotype diversity grouped into multiple diverse groups,The top candidate species cannot be confidently distinguished from other related species,3
7,Preliminary identification confirmation,A,Candidate species is consistent with preliminary morphology ID,The preliminary identification is supported by the molecular data,1
7,Preliminary identification confirmation,B,Candidate species is not consistent with preliminary morphology ID,The molecular data contradicts the preliminary identification,3
